<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
Chorus:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And there's a starwind rising<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Stretching the skyward sails<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Earthborn seeds fly outward<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Let the stars beware<br>
<br>
Feel the stirring in the time-ripe world<br>
See old Gaia smile<br>
Knowing the seed-pod will spring open<br>
In only a little while<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Chorus<br>
<br>
Ancient and long the chain (?) that held us<br>
Tied to the old world's ground<br>
Vast the ancient plan that leads us<br>
To a universe unbound<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Chorus<br>
<br>
Warn your (?) lords of the endless star ways<br>
See your ways undone<br>
Gaia's ferry of (?) children spring<br>
From their prison 'neath the changing sun<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chorus<br>
<br>
Fear the end so long-awaited<br>
As the change of old kind breaks free<br>
Come to break your status with a change<br>
As ever was meant to be<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chorus<br>
</p>
