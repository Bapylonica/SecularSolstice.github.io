<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
 <br>
G# - A - B - E       ......  B - G# A G# E <br>
 <br>
Chasing patterns in the sky...  Trace the line from star to star<br>
Look around and wonder why...  Where we going who we are<br>
Vernal flower, summer breeze...  Cricket wing and autumn leaves<br>
Fractal patterns, golden mean Whispers of a world unseen.<br>
Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise <br>
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking <br>
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Oh... Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Oh... <br>
Chasing patterns in the sky Feeling lost, alone and small<br>
Birds depart and crickets die Frost encroaching, winter falls<br>
Track the omens, year by year Fit the pieces, best you can<br>
Tell a story they can hear Something we can understand<br>
Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise <br>
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking <br>
Where we come from, where we going? Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Oh... Where we come from, where we going?<br>
Oh... <br>
Chasing patterns in the sky Seasons turn and stories change<br>
Weather vane and satellite Rising tide and hurricane<br>
Spiral Arm and Golden Mean Trace the line from star to star<br>
Seeking worlds yet unseen Where we going, who we are?<br>
Where we going, who we are? <br>
