<h2 id="by-bob-dylan-and-joan-baez">By Bob Dylan and Joan Baez</h2>
<h2 id="an-outsiders-blessing-that-verges-on-transhumanism">An outsider's blessing that verges on transhumanism</h2>
<p>There are several melodies for this. We use Joan Baez's. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4UoJ47SzjA">hear her perform it on youtube</a>.</p>
<p>The original first line is &quot;May God bless and keep you always&quot;. We've done this as &quot;May good fortune find you always&quot; and &quot;May you always find good fortune&quot;. The latter is more grammatical, and the inversion is not really poetically appropriate, but the former fits the original rhythm better.</p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
May you always find good fortune<br>
May your wishes all come true<br>
May you always do for others<br>
And let others do for you<br>
<br>
May you build a ladder to the stars<br>
And climb on every rung<br>
May you stay...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                  ....forever young<br>
<br>
<br>
May you grow up to be righteous<br>
May you grow up to be true<br>
May you always know the truth<br>
And see the lights surrounding you<br>
<br>
May you always be courageous<br>
Stand upright and be strong<br>
May you stay...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                  ....forever young<br>
<br>
<br>
Forever young...<br>
Forever young...<br>
May you stay...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                  ....forever young<br>
<br>
<br>
May your hands always be busy<br>
May your feet always be swift<br>
May you have a strong foundation<br>
When the winds of changes shift<br>
<br>
May your heart always be joyful<br>
And may your song always be sung<br>
And may you stay...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                  ....forever young<br>
(Repeat Chorus and Retardando at end)<br>
