<p>This song takes on the &quot;winter&quot; concept most directly: the cold and darkness and <em>danger</em> for the unprepared.</p>
<p>In some places, it is referred to as &quot;Bitter Wind Lullaby&quot; to distinguish it from the later <a href="../../Bitter_Wind_March/gen/">Bitter Wind March</a></p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (skip) <br>
 Sun barely rising a-bove the hor-izon   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Flowers are withering, naked bark brittle oh,   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Don't understand why the light would abandon us,   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
And I don't know how much more he may demand of us   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Sun, sailing a - way I don't know<br>
 Where... I don’t know why…  <br>
 Sky, darkening grey, wishing there<br>
 weren’t so  man-y  good - byes...   <br>
 little one, little one why...   <br>
 little one  why...   <br>
 Asking me questions I don't have the answers to <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Watching you shiver, and I dont know what to do   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Maybe if     we did the dance said the words just right   <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Maybe he'd  come back may-be things would be all right t  <br>
 Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
 Sun, sailing a - way I don't know<br>
 Where... I don’t know why…  <br>
 Sky, darkening grey, wishing there<br>
 weren’t so  man-y  good - byes...   <br>
 little one, little one why...   <br>
 little one  why...   <br>
 little one  why...   <br>
