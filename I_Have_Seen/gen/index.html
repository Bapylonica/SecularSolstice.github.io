<h2 id="the-miracles-of-today-taken-in-context">The miracles of today taken in context</h2>
<p>Based on the blog post <a href="https://medium.com/message/i-have-seen-the-tops-of-clouds-e21c5941de32">I Have Seen the Tops of Clouds</a> by Quinn Norton.</p>
<p>This song has not been tested by actual singers.</p>
<p>I had to invent two small bits of musical notation. When the voice has a dotted whole note, that means to hold through the next measure with the lyrics there sung by someone else. Possibly by the audience. <em>Mostly</em> the song calls for a single singer -- just not those echoes. Also, the C<sup>1.3</sup> chord means just the major third (C and E) with neither A nor G. It's the intersection of A Minor and C Major and is therefore ambiguous as to what it's a part of.</p>
<p>Placing this song in the arc may be tricky. It's a little dark for morning, but the light in it is clearly the light of morning and not the light of the day before.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;To hope is a thing you can choose&quot; may conflict with people's sense of &quot;If we are doomed, I want to believe we are doomed&quot;. But hope isn't about belief -- it's about attention. And that <em>is</em> a thing you can choose.</p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
  Some nights I awake from my bed in cold terror<br>
  with echoes of nightmares just roaming my skin.<br>
  All the wrongs, all the dangers I hold off in daytime<br>
  return to my thoughts as the night closes in.<br>
<br>
  It gets so much harder when monsters are true.<br>
  I can't quite imagine just what we could do.<br>
  A miracle's needed to see us all through.<br>
  But what have we got?  We've got me; we've got you.<br>
  And I...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I have seen the tops of clouds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I can breathe beneath the sea.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I laugh with friends from across the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Where I go a library goes with me.                <br>
<br>
  I see the destruction of earth, sky and ocean.<br>
  See ignorant thinking and hate in the heart,<br>
  Signs of frailty throughout our civilization<br>
  It may be our ticket was punched from the start.<br>
<br>
  I'd never say ``cover your eyes from bad news.''<br>
  But giving up now is a sure way to lose.<br>
  So know that to hope is a thing you can choose.<br>
  Just dig through our past: there are signs; there are clues.<br>
  Like that...<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I have seen the tops of clouds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I can breathe beneath the sea.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I laugh with friends from across the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Where I go a library goes with me.                <br>
<br>
  This isn't a thing that our past selves expected.<br>
  Lord Kelvin assured us that steel cannot fly.<br>
  His mistake was quite subtle and all we need hope for<br>
  Is similar errors in proofs we'll all die.<br>
<br>
  And if we yet meet with the end that we fear,<br>
  'Twill still have been good that this once we were here:<br>
  For one shining moment life saw itself clear,<br>
  And dreamed of how soon to the stars it might steer.<br>
  And how...<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I have seen the tops of clouds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I can breathe beneath the sea.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    I laugh with friends from across the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Where I go a library goes with me.                <br>
<br>
  Yes I have seen the tops of clouds (tops of clouds)<br>
  And I can breathe beneath the sea (the sea)<br>
  And how I laugh with friends from across the world<br>
  Where I go a library goes with me.  Goes with me.<br>
  Goes with me!<br>
<br>
