<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<h2 id="a-song-of-hope-generations-stories-and-infinite-possibilities">A song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities</h2>
<p>This song was written specifically to serve as a replacement for <a href="../Brighter_Than_Today">Brighter Than Today</a> for if/when we needed one. As such, the two often have a bit of tension about where they go. At NYC2017 we tried relieving that tension with slides, declaring &quot;dawn&quot; at the end of Brighter Than Today and increased the lighting throughout Endless Lights.</p>
<p>An alternative we haven't tried is to split this into Endless Lights Above Me (the first verse) in Twilight and Endless Lights Around Me (the other two verses) in Morning.</p>

 <br>
 Mama's been waiting, huddled out - side. <br>
 Brother is quietly holding her tight <br>
 Hurrying home and I hope there's still time for <br>
 One... more... night... <br>
 Slowly she turns... opens her eyes <br>
 Struggles to stand point to the sky <br>
 Barely can breathe but she's telling the stor-ies <br>
 One... last... time... <br>
And she whispers of hunters and dra-gons and gods <br>
 Wanderers roaming the stars up a - bove <br>
 Holding her hand in that moment I wonder, <br>
 Can't help but wonder at all... those... <br>
 End... less... lights... burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there,is anyone out there?<br>
 anyone out there tonight <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Father is waiting for sister and me <br>
 Thousands of miles away, over the sea and we're <br>
 Flying as fast as the Boeing'll carry us <br>
 One... last... time... <br>
 Thinking of stories he told from the war <br>
 Terrible jokes that he made us endure <br>
 Daylight is ending, the plane is descending <br>
 Just... in... time... ... as the<br>
 clouds part around us, a dazz-l-ing city <br>
A ppears like a jewel in the night... <br>
And I look at our home and its lights all a - glow'n and I <br>
 Can't help but wonder at all.. those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there, anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching<br>
A cross.. the vast-ness... <br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can... <br>
 Beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can... <br>
 <br>
 Grandma's been waiting for clues in the dark, and I'm <br>
 Journeying millions of miles to take part. <br>
And finally I see her glint in the viewing port,<br>
 Right... on... time... <br>
 Weightless em brace as the airlock re- seals,<br>
 Space station turning and slowly re- veals:<br>
 Rows upon rows of her telescopes listening<br>
 Deep... through... time... C F<br>
And maybe there's some kind of somebody o-ut there<br>
 Listening in on our radio calls<br>
Or maybe there's not there's just one pale blue dot to give <br>
 Meaning and beauty and worth to it all.<br>
But holding her hand in that moment I wonder,<br>
 Can't help but wonder at all wonder at all... those...<br>
 End... less... lights, burning with<br>
 Un... told... sto-ries, each of them<br>
 One... more... reason to wonder<br>
Is anyone out there... anyone out there?<br>
 End... less... night cradling<br>
 Count... less... voices, reaching <br>
A cross... the vast-ness... <br>
With beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they<br>
 can... <br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they <br>
 can... <br>
 beau-ti-ful stories, lasting as long as they long as they<br>
 can <br>
