#  Endless Lights
## By Raymond Arnold
## A song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This song was written specifically to serve as a replacement for
[Brighter Than Today](../Brighter_Than_Today) for if/when we needed
one.  As such, the two often have a bit of tension about where they
go.  At NYC2017 we tried relieving that tension with slides, declaring
"dawn" at the end of Brighter Than Today and increased the lighting
throughout Endless Lights.

An alternative we haven't tried is to split this into Endless Lights
Above Me (the first verse) in Twilight and Endless Lights Around Me
(the other two verses) in Morning.

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [2015](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015) album.
