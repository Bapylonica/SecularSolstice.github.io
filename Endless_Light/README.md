#  Endless Light
## By Raymond Arnold
## A song of hope, generations, stories and infinite possibilities

This song was written specifically to serve as a replacement for
[Brighter Than Today](../Brighter_Than_Today) for if/when we needed
one.  As such, the two often have a bit of tension about where they
go.
