  A land of tit for tatters
  Is what we'd hoped to be
  But time and place and circumstance
  Don't bend so easily

  Our knowledge isn't perfect
  Of all that went before
  And just a single false defect
  Begets eternal war
  
  Our cities swell with people
  Until the bulk you chance to meet
  Are not ones you will meet again
  In market, field or street.

  Or there may come a meeting
  With risk and consequence so vast
  They render hardly relevant
  What comes once they've gone past

  Some dare to do us wrong here
  Does all this risk belong near?
  How can we move along? We're...

  We're...

      We're living in a one shot.  One Shot.
      It's unforgiving it's a one shot. One Shot.
      It's sink or swimming with a one shot.  One shot.
      One...

  One way we might resolve this
  Would be to read each others' source
  But thinly slicing living brains
  Has issues, yes, of course.

  And if our minds were simpler
  So we could parse another's thought
  That also might just make them simple
  Such that we could not

  I don't think this is solved now
  We wish that we'd evolved how
  This still is not resolved now....

  Now

      We're living in a one shot.  One Shot.
      It's unforgiving it's a one shot. One Shot.
      It's sink or swimming with a one shot.  One shot.
      One...

  shot
