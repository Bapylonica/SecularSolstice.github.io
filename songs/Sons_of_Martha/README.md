Astute fans of the poem will notice I've dropped two stanzas.  It's
still almost five minutes, so I really don't think we want longer.
Very astute fans will notice I moved the final "and" from the end of
the penultimate line to the beginning of the ultimate one.  From a
poetic perspective, it hardly matters, but musically we want to draw
out tension before the punchline.
