  Here's to the folk of Easter Island
  Who's art we admire today
  Their numbers and powers have dwindled 
  With the trees they required gone away

  And here's to the lords of Mississippi
  Mysterious builders of mounds
  They knew not the plagues that assailed them
  We know not the names of their towns

  Yes and here's to the final Western Romans
  Devoured from without and within
  Our scholars still ask just what failed them
  Or how any cure might begin

      So we pour out a toast to the fallen
      And another for those time forgot 
      Who strove with the last ounce of courage
      But strove with enough they did not

  Here's to the good old League of Nations
  Whose quest was 'Prevent World War'
  They hardly impeded the second
  Now let's see how we face three and four

  And here's to the ones who saw it coming
  Whose warnings the world did not heed
  And here's to the ones who died working
  But had not the clues that they'd need

  Yes and here's to the ones who wanted better
  But dared not take eyes off their foes
  And here's to their mansions that burned down
  The fires quite unquenched by their blows 

      So we pour out a toast to the fallen
      And another for those time forgot 
      Who strove with the last ounce of courage
      But strove with enough they did not

  Yes we pour out a toast to the fallen
  And a toast for the ones who now fall
  And we wonder if someday somebody
  Will pour out a toast for us all
