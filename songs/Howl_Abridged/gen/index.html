sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their
brains and imagination?</h2>
<p>Originally a <a href="/speeches/gen/Howl.html">poem</a>, one of the
most famous of the Beat Movement. Also, the inspiration for <a
href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations
on Moloch</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t really converted it into a song. I’ve just put some
suitably creepy cello under it, while shortening it to 11 lines (an
unresolved chromatic scale). The first line has a minor second, and the
interval widens each time until it’s a major seventh. Also, the leading
“Moloch”s go up a minor third from the upper note, then down a tritone,
then back to the drone. All of this <em>may</em> be more clear looking
at the sheet music (no promises).</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,<br>
dragging themselves through the streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,<br>
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,<br>
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?<br>
Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!<br>
 Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!<br>
 Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!<br>
 Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!<br>
 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch  whose name is the Mind!<br>
 Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!<br>
 They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!<br>
