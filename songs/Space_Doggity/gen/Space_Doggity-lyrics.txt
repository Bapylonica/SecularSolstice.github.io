# Verse 1
The cage is very small
A tiny silver ball
That makes you a hero
The moment you step inside
The world is watching you
What you're about to do
Will live on forever
Even though you'll be dead
And gone
Buckle up
We're about to turn the engines on.

# Verse 2
Hello from Sputnik 2
I am receiving you
Thanks for the dog food
I'm somewhere above you now
Guess what Malashenkov?
I took the collar off
I'm holding my own leash
And walking myself outside
This door
I don't think
I want to be a good dog anymore.

# Chorus
Now I'm floating free
And the moon's with me
And it's bright enough
To light the dark
And it's so high up here
And the stars so clear
Are they close enough?
Will they hear me bark from here?

# Solo

# Verse 3
Moscow to Sputnik 2
I think we're losing you
Your life signs are fading
We can't really say that we're
Surprised
It's a shame
There is always something that gets compromised

# Chorus
Now I'm floating free
And the moon's with me
And it's bright enough
To light the dark
And it's so high up here
And the stars so clear
Are they close enough?
Will they hear me bark from here?
