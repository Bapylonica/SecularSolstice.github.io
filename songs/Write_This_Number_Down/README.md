# Write This Number Down
## By Dar Williams
## A measured celebration of justice and rule of law

In the Morning and Light arcs, we've got a bunch of songs about the present being better than the past, and the possibility of the future being better still. Mostly, they're about technology, and knowledge, and prosperity. This is a song about the world becoming more just and compassionate.

The number in the title has a potentially-confusing double meaning:
In the first verse, "Write this number down, you can call it anytime", it's a phone number one might call to ask for help - e.g. the National Lawyer's Guild's "I was arrested for peaceful protest" hotline number (1-212-679-6018). At the end of the song, "there's millions of us there to get your backs [...] write this number down" the same phrase recurs, seemingly referring to the number of people willing to help - "it's growing all the time".
