There is a little country, not very far from here
They don't have crops or money, nor seasons of the year
They don't have laws or churches, so how can we explain
How they learn to work together out of purely selfish gain?

For them the choice is simple, for their lives are not complex
Some days they cooperate, some days they defect
Cooperation's good for all, defection's good for one
And the winners teach their children how to do as they have done

In this country there's a fellow, his name is Tit-for-Tat
He will never hit you first but he will always hit you back
He'll treat you as you treated him the last time that you met
And no one's figured how to get the better of him yet

A tribe that just cooperates does fine if left alone
But one defector in their land would quickly sieze the throne
But a land of Tit-for-Tatters is a land secure and strong
They do right by each other, and none dares to do them wrong

Wherever Tit-for-Tat lives, the Golden Rule is true
Do unto Tit-for-Tat as you'd have him do unto you
Our world is not so simple, but it should be understood
That simple, selfish interest still may serve the greater good
