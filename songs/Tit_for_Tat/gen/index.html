<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
/ GD G C D / C G C D / GD G CD G / CD GEm CD G /<br>
<br>
There is a little country, not very far from here<br>
They don't have crops or money, nor seasons of the year<br>
They don't have laws or churches, so how can we explain<br>
How they learn to work together out of purely selfish gain?<br>
<br>
For them the choice is simple, for their lives are not complex<br>
Some days they cooperate, some days they defect<br>
Cooperation's good for all, defection's good for one<br>
And the winners teach their children how to do as they have done<br>
<br>
In this country there's a fellow, his name is Tit-for-Tat<br>
He will never hit you first but he will always hit you back<br>
He'll treat you as you treated him the last time that you met<br>
And no one's figured how to get the better of him yet<br>
<br>
A tribe that just cooperates does fine if left alone<br>
But one defector in their land would quickly sieze the throne<br>
But a land of Tit-for-Tatters is a land secure and strong<br>
They do right by each other, and none dares to do them wrong<br>
<br>
Wherever Tit-for-Tat lives, the Golden Rule is true<br>
Do unto Tit-for-Tat as you'd have him do unto you<br>
Our world is not so simple, but it should be understood<br>
That simple, selfish interest still may serve the greater good<br>
