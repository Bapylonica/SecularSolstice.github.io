<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
So stranger walk with me...              I'm  walking too...<br>
 walk with me...            We'll journey through<br>
And maybe talk with me...               As partners do <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 Here comes the dark again...    clawing at my heart like a hungry beast  <br>
 Shutting down my eyes like a flask that's empty  <br>
 I want to walk on the solid ground. I want to know what you've been through  <br>
 Want to face what comes together. I am safer with you.  <br>
So stranger walk with me...              I'm  walking too...<br>
 walk with me...            We'll journey through<br>
And maybe talk with me...               As partners do <br>
 Walk with me. Talk with me. Stop with me.  <br>
 As friends can do.  <br>
