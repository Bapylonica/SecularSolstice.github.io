<p>Including the scientific method as verse three is very deliberate. When we judge for ourselves, we are still applying what we’ve been taught <em>about doing that</em>.</p>
<p>The phrase “garden full of forking paths” comes from Andrew Gelman: a frequentist. Cope.</p>
<p>The sheet music and chord chart do not exactly agree. The chord chart is closer to what was performed.</p>
<p>If performing with more than voice and guitar, other instruments should probably stay quiet while the problem is being explained, and come in as it is resolved.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
I got a pro...       blem...       The weather's getting cold...<br>
The northern wind blows sharp &amp; swift my jackets worn and  old<br>
But all  I  need  to   know  is  in  the  tales my poppa   told<br>
<br>
I choose a pelt that thick and warm... measure twice and chalk my form<br>
I cut and stitch 'ere com-ing   sto-o-orm...                      And now I'm<br>
 safe and snug<br>
<br>
I got a pro...       blem...       It seems I lost my way...<br>
I've journeyed forth to lands unknown been wandering all day<br>
I need  some  help.  Can I recall what  did  my  momma say?<br>
<br>
I lift my eyes up   past the air.     Follow the tail of Greater Bear<br>
I see that north  is over there...                    And now I'm<br>
 homeward bound<br>
<br>
I got a pro...       blem...       What if this lore's not true?<br>
What if what worked in days of old don't work for me and you?<br>
I don't despair  I  got a plan; what grampa said to   do!<br>
<br>
I check the facts with my own eyes I  do the math, I analyze<br>
I get a p less than 0h five     And now that<br>
 problem's solved<br>
<br>
I got a pro...       blem...       Results won't replicate!<br>
A garden full of    forking paths, the choice to speak too late<br>
 Can Sol'monoff quite help me here? Do I, um, hang out, wait...<br>
<br>
 I... I got a problem.<br>
