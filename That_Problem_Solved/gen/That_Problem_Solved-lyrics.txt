    
    
    
I got a pro...       blem...       The weather's getting cold...   
The northern wind blows sharp & swift my jackets worn and  old   
But all  I  need  to   know  is  in  the  tales my poppa   told   
    
I choose a pelt that thick and warm... measure twice and chalk my form   
I cut and stitch 'ere com-ing   sto-o-orm...                      And now I'm
 safe and snug   
    
I got a pro...       blem...       It seems I lost my way...   
I've journeyed forth to lands unknown been wandering all day   
I need  some  help.  Can I recall what  did  my  momma say?   
    
I lift my eyes up   past the air.     Follow the tail of Greater Bear   
I see that north  is over there...                    And now I'm
 homeward bound   
    
I got a pro...       blem...       What if this lore's not true?   
What if what worked in days of old don't work for me and you?   
I don't despair  I  got a plan; what grampa said to   do!   
    
I check the facts with my own eyes I  do the math, I analyze   
I get a p less than 0h five     And now that
 problem's solved   
    
I got a pro...       blem...       Results won't replicate!   
A garden full of    forking paths, the choice to speak too late   
 Can Sol'monoff quite help me here? Do I, um, hang out, wait...   
    
 I... I got a problem.
