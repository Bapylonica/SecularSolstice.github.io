# The Contract Drafting Em
## By Zack Davis
## The special horror when your employer has root on your brain

I'm not sure anyone ever wrote a melody for this.

This is one of the few songs that will truly *lose* outsiders.  Anyone
who doesn't know what an Em is, or have an intuitive sense of what
being one could feel like will simply *not know* what's going on.
This is both a good and a bad thing.  Barring outsiders creates a
stronger sense of community, and that this is *our* space.  On the
other hand, some of those people are people we'd rather have around.
Proceed with caution.
