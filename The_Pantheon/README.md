#  The Pantheon aka Ain't Gonna Catch You
## By Darren Korb
## There is no one to protect you from yourself

Originally from the video game Bastion ([Original Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s3b5OR2YhE)).  The specific gods listed are from that game.

Raymond Arnold offered a variant with more familiar gods:


> Yahweh... cranky old man,    
> Gonna smite ya for what you done
>
> Cthulhu... hungry deep one    
> Gonna eat ya for what you done
>
> Azathoth... blind designer,    
> Tear yer mind up for what you done

The reference to Yahweh is likely to alienate those who practice some form of Abrahamic tradition, especially since the smite-happy cranky old man is a weak-man if not straw-man of the tradition.

A possibly alternative might be:

> Moloch... baby eater,    
> Burn your soul down for what you done.

As an added benefit, Cthulhu/Azathoth/Moloch now form a Body/Mind/Soul threat, which is nicely elegant.
