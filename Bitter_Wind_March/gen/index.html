<h2 id="a-return-to-bitter-wind-blown-but-with-determination-to-do-something-about-it">A return to Bitter Wind Blown, but with determination to do something about it</h2>
<p>Musically, this song is a reprise of <a href="../../Bitter_Wind_Blown/gen/">Bitter Wind Blown</a> and it has been known as &quot;Bitter Wind Reprise&quot; in some documents. Conceptually, it introduces a new idea: that instead of asking the sun to save us, we're going to save ourselves.</p>
<p>In orchestrating this song, it is important not to let it get too militant or hopeful. That would turn it into a Song of Dawn, and step on Brighter Than Today's toes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKx-NQ6iWU">NYC 2016 Performance</a> is on Youtube</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in <a href="https//humanistculture.bandcamp.com/">all three albums</a>.</p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
Sun barely rising a-bove the hor-izon<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
Flowers are withering, naked bark brittle oh,<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
Good folk are gonna die, sun-god ain't shedding tears<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
And I just stare at the sky, digging the graves each year<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
Sun, sailing away, I don't know where... I don’t know why...<br>
Sky, darkening grey, wishing there weren’t so many goodbyes...<br>
Little one, little one why...<br>
Little one  why...<br>
<br>
Maybe if we looked a while and found a stone<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
Dragged it a hun-der-ed  miles and    got it home<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
We could dig us a henge, raise those bluestones up high<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
In two hundred years we could look at the sky<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
Our children would know when the winter was coming, oh<br>
<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
Looking and laboring,    doing what must be done<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
Sun, sailing away, I don't know where... I don’t know why...<br>
Sky, darkening grey, wishing there weren’t so many goodbyes...<br>
<br>
And maybe some good folk are still going to die <br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown   <br>
<br>
Their mothers shake helpless with rage and denial<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
But maybe it might be less deep of a sorrow<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
<br>
Not quite so many graves dug up tomorrow<br>
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown<br>
