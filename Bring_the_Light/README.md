#  Bring the Light

## By Alex Federici and Raymond Arnold
## We call out to the sun with imagery of different eras

The simplicity and call-and-response structure of this song make it
very easy to learn.  They also risk making it tedious.

recording](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/bring-the-light-3)
(of a slightly old version) is available.
