<p>The simplicity and call-and-response structure of this song make it very easy to learn. They also risk making it tedious.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/bring-the-light-3">audio recording</a> (of a slightly old version) is available.</p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Bring the light  <br>
Bring the  li-ight  <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Bring the light    ( Bring the light)<br>
Bring the  li-ight  ( Bring the li-ight)<br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
 Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine... Bring it  back just one more<br>
time... Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine............   let it<br>
shine on me...  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Drive your chariot (Bring the Light)   <br>
Pull the flame     (Bring the Li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Battle the moon     (Bring the light)   <br>
Darkness looms     (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Speak the word      (Bring the light)   <br>
Let it be           (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Stardust gather     (Bring the light)   <br>
Fusing matter       (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
 Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine... Bring it  back just one more<br>
time... Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine............   let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
