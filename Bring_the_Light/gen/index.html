<p>The simplicity and call-and-response structure of this song make it very easy to learn. They also risk making it tedious.</p>
<p>Early versions of this song explicitly taught the response pattern. This has been found to be unnecessary. A few hand gestures, the slides, and an audience a third of whom know the song are sufficient.</p>
<p>There really isn't a canonical version of this song. The chord chart here is from NYC2016, and the sheet music from NYC2017 (reconstructed from Daniel Speyer's memory). Verses come and go easily. The chorus, which NYC2017 banished to the <a href="../../Bring_the_Light_Reprise/gen">reprise</a>, can be inserted after any even numbered verse. Furthermore, the melodies that go with the lyrics have been whatever seemed right to the singer, and that has varied from year to year. And when the written chords don't fit the sung melody, the instrumentalists have followed the singer. In short, <em>nothing</em> on this page necessarily matches any given performance.</p>
<p>Treat this page as containing <em>examples</em> of this song, not as containing <em>the song</em>.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Bring the light  <br>
Bring the  li-ight  <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Bring the light    ( Bring the light)<br>
Bring the  li-ight  ( Bring the li-ight)<br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
 Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine... Bring it  back just one more<br>
time... Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine............   let it<br>
shine on me...  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Drive your chariot (Bring the Light)   <br>
Pull the flame     (Bring the Li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Battle the moon     (Bring the light)   <br>
Darkness looms     (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Speak the word      (Bring the light)   <br>
Let it be           (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
Stardust gather     (Bring the light)   <br>
Fusing matter       (Bring the li-ight)   <br>
Oh  bring the light and let it<br>
shine on me  <br>
 Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine... Bring it  back just one more<br>
time... Bring the  light and let it<br>
shine............   let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let it<br>
shine on  me   <br>
