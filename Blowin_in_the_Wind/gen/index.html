<h2 id="a-catalogue-of-the-worlds-problems-from-a-vaguely-hopeful-perspective">A catalogue of the world's problems from a vaguely hopeful perspective</h2>
<p>The arrangement used here is different from the original Dylan, modified to fit into the Night section better. Some people, but not most, find this produces an uncanny valley effect.</p>
<p>The catalogue of woes from the 1960s is remarkably (and disturbingly) topical, but the refrain (&quot;The answer is blowin' in the wind&quot;) is certainly not our perspective.</p>
<p>If using this song, consider its role as a sacred anthem of hippiism, a philosophy we have a complex relationship with.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
<br>
How many roads must a man walk down<br>
Before you call him a man?<br>
How many seas must a white dove sail<br>
Before she sleeps in the sand?<br>
How many times must the cannonballs fly<br>
Before they're forever banned?<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
<br>
<br>
How many years must a mountain exist<br>
Before it is washed to the sea?<br>
How many years can some people exist<br>
Before they're allowed to be free?<br>
How many times can a man turn his head<br>
And pretend that he just doesn't see?<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
<br>
<br>
How many times must a man look up<br>
Before he can see the sky?<br>
How many ears must one man have<br>
Before he can hear people cry?<br>
How many deaths will it take till he knows<br>
That too many people have died?<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
<br>
