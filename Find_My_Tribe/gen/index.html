<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
I'm rugged. Self Reliant.<br>
Like to stand alone.<br>
Figure shit out on my own.<br>
Metacontrarian to the bone.<br>
<br>
Metacontrarian to the bone... ...oh....<br>
<br>
I must confess I take some satisfaction,<br>
Pointin’, laughin’,<br>
All that tribal nonsense,<br>
Blatant fiction,<br>
All with such absurd conviction.<br>
Yet...<br>
<br>
And yet I must admit sometimes...<br>
...I think it might be kinda nice...<br>
...I really wish that I...<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
<br>
Could find a tribe.... that I could call my own...<br>
Find my kind... wanna build a home...<br>
Wanna carve me a cultural cornerstone...<br>
Wanna find my tribe, find my tribe<br>
Find my tribe, find my tribe..<br>
<br>
Find my tribe tribe, find my tribe...<br>
...find my tribe.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Don’t want my identity<br>
Consumed within the hive<br>
Fraid that ideology'll<br>
Slip its tendrils in my mind<br>
<br>
And yet sometimes, it seems<br>
Its not so awful of a dream,<br>
To know I got my people’s back<br>
And know that they got mine<br>
<br>
I wanna find a tribe.... that I could call my own...<br>
Find my kind... wanna build a home...<br>
Wanna carve me a cultural cornerstone...<br>
Wanna find my tribe, find my tribe<br>
Find my tribe, find my tribe..<br>
<br>
Find my tribe tribe, find my tribe...<br>
...find my tribe.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
(Instrumental something or other)<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
A burning itch to know,<br>
No matter how the truth might sting<br>
A deep dissatisfaction with a <br>
Status quo so maddening,<br>
<br>
If I found folk who always try,<br>
To question why and understand<br>
Keep on striving, optimizin'<br>
Building somethin' grand.<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
<br>
Gonna find a tribe.... that we can call our own...<br>
Gonna find our kind... we’re gonna build a home...<br>
Gonna carve us a cultural cornerstone...<br>
Gonna find our tribe, find our tribe<br>
Find our tribe, find our tribe...<br>
<br>
Find my tribe, find my tribe.<br>
