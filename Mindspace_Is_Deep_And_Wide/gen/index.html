<p>The sheet music was reconstructed from very dim memory so it surely contains mistakes. Also, the verses don't have exactly the same rhythm, which was awkward to write down. Take it as a starting point, and then sing something that sounds good.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
  There’s a lotta ways that you can optimize  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  One of those ways is to be a mind  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But that ain’t narrow enough for me  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Minds are bigger than the sea    (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  Lotta ways  to  think!  (Lotta ways to think!)<br>
  Lotta ways to feel! (Lotta ways to feel!)<br>
  Lotta ways to decide! (Lotta ways to de cide!)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  There’s a lotta ways to self modify  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Lotta reasons you may want to try  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But that’s all just the tip ofthe ‘berg  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Sometimes minds get pretty absurd  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  You could be a crustacean (be a crustacean)<br>
  Or an emulation (or an emulation)<br>
  Or an A G I (or an A G I)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  Lotta values that you could prize   (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Lotta things to try an’ maximize   (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But sometimes minds are blindto their goals  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Hard time peering into your soul  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  You could care about babies (care about babies) <br>
  Paperclips maybe (paperclips maybe)<br>
  Stayin’ alive (staying alive)<br>
  Mindspace is deep and wide<br>
<br>
  Gotta be careful what you assume  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Typical mind could be your doom  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  But I hope that you have come to see  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
  Minds are as big as infinity  (Mindspace is Deep and Wide!)<br>
<br>
  Mindspace is deep... and wide...<br>
<br>
