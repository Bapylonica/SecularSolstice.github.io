<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Hands chip the flint, light the fire, skin the kill flint, light the fire, skin the kill<br>
Feet move the tribe track the   herd with a will   <br>
Human-kind struggles, on the edge of histo ry<br>
Time to settle down, time to grow, time to breed down, time to  grow, time to breed..<br>
...   (skip)<br>
Plow tills the soil, plants the seed, pray for rain   <br>
Scythe reaps the wheat, to the  mill, to grind the grain   <br>
Towns.. and.. cities spread to  empire over - night   <br>
Hands keep    building as we   chant the ancient rite...   <br>
...   (skip)<br>
Coal heats the steam, push the piston, turns the wheel   <br>
Cogs spin the wool, drives the horses made of steel   <br>
Lightning harnessed does our will and lights the dark   <br>
Keep rising   higher,  set our  goal, hit the mark...   <br>
...   (skip)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Crawl.. out..  of...  the  mud.   <br>
On...   go... ing...  but slow.   <br>
path...  that  is    easy <br>
one... that... makes us grow <br>
  (skip) (skip)<br>
Light push the sails, read the  data, cities  glow   <br>
Hands type the keys, tap the screen, out we go!   <br>
Our voices carry round the world and into space   <br>
Send us out to colonize another placeÂ¸   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (skip)<br>
Hands, make the tools, light fire, plant the grain   <br>
Feet, track the herd. Build a world. Begin again...   <br>
 (transition directly into 5000 years)  <br>
