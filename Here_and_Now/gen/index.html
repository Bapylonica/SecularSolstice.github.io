<h2 id="by-raymond-arnold">By Raymond Arnold</h2>
<h2 id="a-celebration-of-now">A celebration of now</h2>
<p>These lyrics are for a week before a Star Wars launch. Week after is trivial. Same day (the original lyrics) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here and now, here and now We've got smallpox locked up tight. Here and now, here and now Brand new Star Wars out tonight! Here and now, here and now Gotta run and catch my flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song premiered along with The Force Awakens, which was especially exciting. The plan was to change the lyric the next year, but Rogue One happened and by now it's become something of a tradition.</p>
<p>There'd be a certain logic in updating this song regularly, but somehow it doesn't seem to need it.</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a href="https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015">2015</a> album.</p>

Grandma told me   stories...  'bout life from way back when   <br>
Walking uphill both ways through the snow.  <br>
Rugged people trudging down the narrow path   a - head <br>
Going where their dad-dy said  to  go   <br>
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby <br>
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but <br>
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   <br>
Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? <br>
now... here and  now...    we got  choices all a - round <br>
 now...   we got interest com - pound...ing. <br>
Taking things for granted that'd shatter Newton's mind <br>
 morrow's here and now <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby <br>
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but <br>
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   <br>
Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? <br>
now... here and  now...    we got  pens instead of swords <br>
 now...   turning ploughshares into tractors <br>
Taking things for granted, super- stim-u-lus ga - lore <br>
 morrow's here and now now <br>
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby <br>
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but <br>
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   <br>
Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
now... here and   now...    we got  deeper truths to seek <br>
 now...   'nother Star Wars out next week <br>
 now...   got  pa - ra-me-ters  to   tweak  <br>
 morrow's here and now now <br>
now... here and  now...    we got  robots driving  cars<br>
 now...   Elon's col-o-ni-zing Mars<br>
 now...   we got smart philanthro-py <br>
 rigor and some   met-a-na-ly - ses. Yeah! <br>
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby <br>
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but <br>
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   <br>
Riddles to  un - ravel...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting<br>
for...   <br>
