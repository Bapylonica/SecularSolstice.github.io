Walking uphill both ways through the snow.  
Rugged people trudging down the narrow path   a - head 
Going where their dad-dy said  to  go   
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? 
now... here and  now...    we got  choices all a - round 
 now...   we got interest com - pound...ing. 
Taking things for granted that'd shatter Newton's mind 
 morrow's here and now 
   
   
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
Riddles to  un - ravel, ba by       what you waiting   for?   for? 
now... here and  now...    we got  pens instead of swords 
 now...   turning ploughshares into tractors 
Taking things for granted, super- stim-u-lus ga - lore 
 morrow's here and now now

now... here and   now...    we got  deeper truths to seek 
 now...   'nother Star Wars out next week 
 now...   got  pa - ra-me-ters  to   tweak  
 morrow's here and now now 
now... here and  now...    we got  robots driving  cars
 now...   Elon's col-o-ni-zing Mars

 rigor and some   met-a-na-ly - ses. Yeah! 
Way     back   when...  Everything seemed simple baby 
Some    day    soon...       maybe  it'll all make    sense again but 
Here   and     now...        got a  world to explore.   Got some   
Riddles to  un - ravel...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
for...  ...    tell me   what you waiting
for...
