#  Here and Now
## By Raymond Arnold
## A celebration of now

These lyrics are for a week before a Star Wars launch.  Week after is
trivial.  Same day (the original lyrics) is:

> Here and now, here and now
> We've got smallpox locked up tight.
> Here and now, here and now
> Brand new Star Wars out tonight!
> Here and now, here and now
> Gotta run and catch my flight.

The song premiered along with The Force Awakens, which was especially
exciting.  The plan was to change the lyric the next year, but Rogue
One happened and by now it's become something of a tradition.

There'd be a certain logic in updating this song regularly, but
somehow it doesn't seem to need it.
