The careful textbooks measure...   let all who build be-  ware<br>
The load, the shock, the pressure...  ma-  te-r-i-al  can bear<br>
So when the buckled  girder...   lets down the grinding span<br>
The blame of loss or  murder...     is la-id upon the man<br>
  .. .. not on the steel...  ...  ...  the man<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
But in our dail - y dealings... with stone and steel we find<br>
The gods have no such feeling...    of justice towards man kind<br>
To no set gauge they make us...    to no laid course pre- pare<br>
In time they over take us...  with loads we cannot bear<br>
  .. ..   to merci less...   ...  ...    to bear<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
The pru-dent text-books give it...    in ta - bles  at...  the end<br>
The stress that shears a rivet...      or  makes a tie - bar bend<br>
What traffic  wrecks  ma- cadam...    what concrete should en- dure<br>
But we poor sons of  Adam...     have  no   such   li - tera - ture<br>
  .. .. to warn us or...           make sure...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
We hold all Earth to plun der...               all time and space as well<br>
Too won-der   stale  to won-der...       at each  new  mira - cle<br>
What traffic  wrecks  ma - cadam...      what concrete should en- dure<br>
But we poor sons of  Adam...        have no  such  liter - a - ture<br>
  ...   ...     to warn us or...             make sure...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
We on - ly  in  crea tion...(how-much luckier the bridge and rail<br>
Too won-der   stale  to won-der...       at each  new  mira - cle<br>
What traffic  wrecks  ma - cadam...      what concrete should en- dure<br>
But we poor sons of  Adam...        have no  such  liter - a - ture<br>
  ...   ...     to warn us or...             make sure...<br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
Oh veiled and se - cret power...   whose paths we seek in vain<br>
Be with us in our  hour...       of o-ver-throw and pain<br>
That we by which sole to- ken...        we know thy ways are  TRUE<br>
In spite  of  be-ing broken...  or be cause of be-ing  broken<br>
  ...  rise up and build... a-new... <br>
 interlude   (skip)<br>
