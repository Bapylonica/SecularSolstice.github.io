<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
Move the World<br>
© 2012 Raymond Arnold<br>
<br>
Archimedes said if I wanna move a load, gotta <br>
get myself a lever, lay it on a fulcrum. <br>
Little bit of effort over quite a bit o’ distance.<br>
I can move a load as big as I wish. I can:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          <br>
	Move the World, if my lever is long enough <br>
	Move the World, and I’ve a place to stand, I can <br>
	Move the World, I can make myself strong enough to <br>
	Move the World, if I got a good plan<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      <br>
But I gotta’dmit that the world’s pretty big<br>
And all I got here in my hand is a pitiful twig.<br>
But if I met a friend with a great big beam,<br>
I could say “Hey Friend!” if you share my dream, you can:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          <br>
	Move the World, if your lever is long enough <br>
	Move the World, and you’ve a place to stand, you can <br>
	Move the World, you can make myself strong enough to <br>
	Move the World, if you have a good plan<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          <br>
But it seems the beam is still not long enough. <br>
Simple tools a pretty cool but this is kinda tough (But maybe) <br>
If we work together we can build a bigger lever,<br>
We can make the world better if we give it a shove. We can:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          <br>
	Move the World, if our lever is long enough <br>
	Move the World, and we’ve a place to stand, we can <br>
	Move the World, we can make myself strong enough to <br>
	Move the World, if we have a good plan, we can<br>
	    <br>
	Move the World, if our lever is long enough <br>
	Move the World, and we’ve a place to stand, we can <br>
	Move the World, we can make myself strong enough to <br>
	Move the World, if we have a good plan, we can<br>
	    <br>
