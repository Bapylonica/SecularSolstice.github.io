<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,   <br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;   <br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand   <br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame   <br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name   <br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand   <br>
Glows world-wide welcome; Her mild eyes command   <br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.   <br>
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she   <br>
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,   <br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,   <br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.   <br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,   <br>
And I will lift my lamp beside the golden door   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
tired Give me your poor huddled masses\  <br>
yearning... to breathe free   Give me your<br>
tired Give me your wretched, your homeless  <br>
tempest tossed, send them to me   <br>
tired the lost who are trying to get found  <br>
tired looking for solid ground  <br>
tired   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
And I see you. Your hope and your courage, on your distant teeming shore   <br>
And I'm standing lifting my lamp beside that golden door   <br>
