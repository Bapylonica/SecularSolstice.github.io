<h2>Lyrics</h2><p>
<br>
A possible child,<br>
Dreaming through the longest night,<br>
A possible smile,<br>
Waking to a distant light,<br>
<br>
A whole world of possibilities<br>
Tell me what you see,<br>
Where's that child going, tell me<br>
Who's that child gonna be...<br>
<br>
In (Five thousand years)<br>
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another)<br>
(Five thousand years)<br>
(Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another)<br>
<br>
(Five thousand years)<br>
(If we boldly set our sights, )<br>
(And journey through the coldest night)<br>
(In five thousand years...)<br>
<br>
...           <br>
(Five thousand years...) <br>
<br>
Build ourselves a brand new home,<br>
Raise the glass domes high.<br>
And in a century or three<br>
Our children might look at the sky<br>
<br>
And then at last they'd see<br>
That distant yellow sun.<br>
The cradle of humanity,<br>
And all the things we might become...<br>
<br>
In (Five thousand years)<br>
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another)<br>
(Five thousand years)<br>
(Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another)<br>
<br>
(Five thousand years)<br>
(If we sailed across the stars.)<br>
(Unimaginably far)<br>
(In five thousand years...)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And maybe good folk still might die,<br>
But maybe not, we gotta try<br>
I don't quite know what shape we'd take<br>
I don't quite know what world we'd make<br>
<br>
I don't quite know how things might change<br>
I don't quite know what rules we'd break<br>
Our present selves might think it strange<br>
But there's so many lives at stake...<br>
<br>
Entropy is bearin' down<br>
But we got tricks to stick around.<br>
And if we live to see the day<br>
That yellow might fade to red then grey,<br>
<br>
We'll take a moment, one by one<br>
Turn to face the dying su-un<br>
Bittersweetly wave goodbye--<br>
The journey's only just begun...<br>
<br>
In (Five thousand years)<br>
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another)<br>
(Five million years)<br>
(Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another)<br>
<br>
(Five billion years)<br>
(When all that we once knew is gone)<br>
(We'll find a way to carry on)<br>
(In five billion years...)<br>
<br>
(Five billion years)<br>
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha want to see-ee)<br>
(Five billion years)<br>
(Where we wanna go...)<br>
<br>
(Who we wanna be?)<br>
Where we wanna go...<br>
Who we wanna be?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
