{type:'text', title:' Hot Seat',content:["Dividing the group in groups of ~4 people each. Going around, everyone is in the "Hot seat" for 5 minutes each. That means that others are asking you questions they are interested in hearing the answer to - whatever they want to ask. The person in focus is allowed to answer the question, refuse an answer or lie. (Plus some more rules etc.)",
"This game can be an initial get-to know but ideally helps people ask deep questions that they wouldn't dare to ask in the usual social context (such as e.g. "What are you most afraid of?") and for the receiving end to answer them while being sure to get heard and listened to. After going around the circle and giving everyone the chance to be in the hot seat, the group discusses their experience and then returns in the larger circle to share their insights and feelings from the session.",

{type:'text', title:' The Raisin Meditation',content:["*[Should be performed with an actual raisin]*",
"Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or between your finger and thumb.",
"Seeing: Take time to really focus on it; gaze at the raisin with care and full attention—imagine that you’ve just dropped in from Mars and have never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes explore every part of it, examining the highlights where the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.",
"Touching: Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its texture. Maybe do this with your eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.",
"Smelling: Hold the raisin beneath your nose. With each inhalation, take in any smell, aroma, or fragrance that may arise. As you do this, notice anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth or stomach.",
"Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand and arm know exactly how and where to position it. Gently place the raisin in your mouth; without chewing, noticing how it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your tongue.",
"Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how and where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one or two bites into it and notice what happens in the aftermath, experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of taste and texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by moment. Also pay attention to any changes in the object itself.",
"Swallowing: When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can first detect the intention to swallow as it comes up, so that even this is experienced consciously before you actually swallow the raisin.",
"Following: Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin moving down into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you have completed this exercise.",
