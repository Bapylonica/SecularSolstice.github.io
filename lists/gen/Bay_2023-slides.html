  "From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design,   \n",
  " Strikeslip fault and overthrust and syn and anticline. . .   \n",
  "We gaze upon cre - ation where e - rosion makes it known,   \n",
  "And count the countless aeons in the banding of the stone.   \n",
  " Odd long vanished creatures & their tracks & shells are found   \n",
  "Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground.   \n",
  "The patient stone can speak, if we but listen when it talks.   \n",
  " Humans wrote the book of earth...              ...  time   wrote the\n",
  " Rocks   \n",
  " There are those who name the stars, who watch the sky by night,   \n",
  " Seeking out the darkest place, to better see the light.   \n",
  " Long ago, when threats and trials broke his weary will,   \n",
  " Galileo recanted, but the Earth is moving still.   \n",
  " High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars,   \n",
  "The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars   \n",
  " We may watch and study or may   shudder and de-ny   \n",
  " Humans wrote the book of night\u2026   ...   fire wrote the\n",
  " sky...   \n",
  " By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur,   \n",

  "When the days are gettin' shorter, and the nights are growin' long,\n",
  "And the north wind puts a tear into your eye,\n",
  "If you're out about 'round midnight and you look off to the east,\n",
  "There you may see bold Orion on the rise.\n",
  "You may know him by his stance or the starry shield he holds,\n",
  "As he rises silent in a clear cold sky.\n",
  "Young Jack Frost and Old Man Winter, they both beckon to the call\n",
  "Of their master bold Orion on the rise.\n",
  "CHORUS: Bold Orion, mighty hunter, rising in a clear cold sky,\n",
  "See the summer fall before him. Bold Orion's on the rise.\n",
  "For seven starry ages, he has ruled the winter skies\n",
  "With the fires of lost eons in his eyes.\n",
  "He has seen the rise and fall of kings and continents and all,\n",
  "Rising silent, bold Orion on the rise.\n",
  "When he ascends, no hesitation; when he moves, no turnin' round,\n",
  "Like a soul been called to glory, earthly born but heavenly bound.\n",
  "Now the bird is on the wing, and it's southward that she flies,\n",
  "Hastened on by bold Orion on the rise. CHORUS\n",
  "Orion had a lover. She's the goddess of the hunt,\n",
  "And of the forest and the golden moon.\n",
  "Artemis they called her, the fair sister of the sun,\n",
  "But their time together ended all too soon.\n",
  "Apollo took his vengeance on the man his sister loved.\n",
  "An arrow sped him to a painful death;\n",
  "But once a month she visits him, a moon among the stars,\n",
  "Looking down with whispered love upon her breath. CHORUS\n",
  "Summer comes on all too slowly, and it passes far too fast,\n",
  "And you wonder, is there nothin' that can last?\n",
  "Here today and gone tomorrow as the green leaves turn to red,\n",
  "As the present quickly turns into the past.\n",
  "Cut the wood and stack it high now. Stoke the fires in your home.\n",
  "Burnin' nightly send the smoke up to the sky.\n",
  "Keep the winter at your door and keep the summer in your heart.\n",
  "Drink a toast to bold Orion on the rise. CHORUS 2X\n"
