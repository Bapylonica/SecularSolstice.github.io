  "Raise a song, and so commence\n",
  "Circle, grow and grow.\n",
  "in praise of all Benevolence!\n",
  "Circle, grow and grow.\n",
  "Once a cold and silent night\n",
  "did the loveless stars pervade;\n",
  "yet we here, of star-stuff made,\n",
  "cast a circle of warmer Light!\n",
  "Circle, circle, grow and grow.\n",
  "So will we bring our families in,\n",

  "And will we bring our neighbors in,\n",
  "Circle, grow and grow.\n",
  "our expansion to begin?\n",

  "Think upon the mystery:\n",
  "how alike is Humankind!\n",
  "Tho' manifold in face and mind,\n",
  "conspecific sisters we!\n",
