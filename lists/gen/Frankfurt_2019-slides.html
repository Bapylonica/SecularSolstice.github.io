"along a wall (write large and in sharpie).",
"When people bring last-minute content, insert it somewhere",

"results in a suboptimal total ordering, it's not worth the time.",
"Then go over the entire proposed schedule with everyone and make sure",
"everybody's ok with it.  Make changes as needed.",

"One player is the Samurai - she starts by lifting her Katana (sword), making a Japanese- nsounding grunt. She keeps her sword up in the air, and her 2 neighbors "slaughter" her, by swinging their swords into her sides, again grunting enthusiastically and in pseudo-japanese. When the neighbors retract their swords, the Samurai lowers her sword; while doing this she makes eye contact with another player, when then becomes Samurai, and everything starts all over again.",

"You can expect your attendees to have widely varying skills and confidence regarding cooking.  Be prepared to give some people supporting roles.",
"It is likely wise to have a central point of co-ordination and to do some planning.  This way, you don't have five desserts and no main course (unless, of course, you want that) or three dishes that need to be baked at different temperatures at the same time in only one oven.",
"We don't really have traditional solstice foods, though things requiring long preparation or low-tech preservation have been proposed.",
