  <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes <br>
 How do you measure, measure a year? <br>
 In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee <br>
 In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife <br>
 In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes <br>
 How do you measure a year in the life <br>
How about love.... How about love? <br>
How about love.... How about love? <br>
Measure in love.... Measure in love.<br>
Measure in love.... ...Sea...sons... of<br>
 love.... lo-o-ove... seasons of<br>
 love.... lo-o-ove... <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan <br>
 Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes <br>
 How do you measure the life of a woman or a man? <br>
 In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried? <br>
 In bridges he burned, or the way that she died <br>
 It's time now to sing out, tho' the story never ends <br>
 Let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends <br>
Remember the love.... Remember the love<br>
Remember the love.... Remember the love<br>
Measure in love.... Measure in love.<br>
Measure in love.... ...Sea...sons... of<br>
 love.... lo-o-ove... seasons of<br>
 love.... lo-o-ove... <br>
