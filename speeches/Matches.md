*[Originally written as a rap, could be recited that way or not]*

The reason that I'm not a nihilist    
Is some day I wanna live like in Star Trek    
And I know that we'll never build starships    
Until we tackle poverty, war, and hardship    
    
So we fight overnight and over lifetimes    
Organize for that warp drive    
And of course I realize    
That we're a long way from it    
But what better reason to start runnin'?    
    
Cause if you're gonna do the work then it's gotta be honest    
Because the best of us have all already been forgotten    
And if you're in it for the recognition    
I hate to disappoint but if you do it right you'll never get it    
    
Yo, we don't remember the farmer    
We remember the fruit    
We don't remember the inventor    
We remember the boom    
The impact through the eons    
So I know what side of history I wanna be on    
    
I got a lot of ancestors on my side    
Got a ancestor took an arrow to the chest and survived    
I got an ancestor who cheated and lied    
I got an ancestor who taught her children how to fight    
    
Right?    
    
So much spirit in my corner    
Can't help but color outside every border    
To every ancestor who kept my song alive    
I swear on your unmarked graves    
I will sing it 'til I die    
    
No friction; no flame;    
No struggle; no progress;    
No sweat    
How many times do we have to win    
'Til you realize that we have not lost yet?    
No friction; no flame;    
No struggle; no progress;    
No sweat    
How many times do we have to win    
'Til you realize that we are not lost yet?    
    
What is it, yeah?    
    
What is it?    
If it ain't somethin'    
Then it's the other thing    
That's bothering me    
Haagar the Horrible    
Most rhetorical lesson ever received    
Was there was no need    
For no money, no greed    
Only prophecy, shit    
    
I'm inspired by this openness in other matters    
Scream at the wall and hope it shatters    
Into a thousand pieces    
Enemy of the state is what I became    
Wearing Patti Smith's marching shoes    
    
Rock and roll, nigga, I became, become    
Why am I the only one who looks different?    
Paint me as the new eccentric    
If I had it my way Minneapolis would be Piss Christ    
Spinning in hell above the lakes    
No one even knows the names of and if you do    
You have too much time on your fucking hands    
That's why you pace about the room trying not to give a damn    
    
I'm kicking down the door    
Like I did inside the womb    
Pause 'til the interlude    
There's something funky to you    
Forget whatever you thought you knew    
Cause none of that bullshit will serve you    
I'll be there in due time    
Until then:    
    
No friction; no flame;    
No struggle; no progress;    
No sweat    
How many times do we have to win    
'Til you realize that we have not lost yet?    
No friction; no flame;    
No struggle; no progress;    
No sweat    
How many times do we have to win    
'Til you realize that we are not lost yet?    
    
There are no stories told in a vacuum    
There is no prophecy lighting our way    
There is just a lot of darkness to be afraid of    
So it's a good thing we are not afraid    
    
There is no Superman in that phone booth    
There is no rewarding our faith    
There is no one who can save us    
So it's a good thing we don't need to be saved    
    
There are no starships in low earth orbit    
No aliens to save us from ourselves    
There is no voice willing to speak for us    
So it's a good thing we know how to yell!    
    
There is no chosen one, no destiny, no fate    
There's no such thing as magic    
There is no light at the end of this tunnel    
So it's a good thing we brought matches
