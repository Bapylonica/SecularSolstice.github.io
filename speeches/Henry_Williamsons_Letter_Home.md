# Henry Williamson's Letter Home

Dear Mother, I am writing from the trenches. It is 11 o'clock in the
morning. Beside me is a coke fire, opposite me a 'dug-out' (wet) with
straw in it. The ground is sloppy in the actual trench, but frozen
elsewhere. In my mouth is a pipe presented by the Princess Mary. In
the pipe is tobacco. Of course, you say. But wait. In the pipe is
German tobacco. Haha, you say, from a prisoner or found in a captured
trench. Oh dear, no! From a German soldier. Yes a live German soldier
from his own trench. Yesterday the British & Germans met & shook hands
in the Ground between the trenches, & exchanged souvenirs, & shook
hands. Yes, all day Xmas day, & as I write. Marvellous, isn't it?
