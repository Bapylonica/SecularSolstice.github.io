# Call and Response: Defiance
## By Jai Dhyani

(Speaker lines in *italics*, audience response in **bold**)

*The universe is vast, and dark, and cold.*

**But we are not.**

*The stars are silent, and ancient, and impossibly far away.*

**But we are not.**

*The laws of physics are indifferent to hope, or desperation, or love.*

**But we are not!**

*Does anything in the universe care?*

**Yes! We care! There is light in the world, and it is us!**

*We are flawed.*

**We’re learning.**

*We are fragile.*

**We’re getting stronger.**

*To the best of our knowledge, we are alone in the universe.*

**But we have each other.**

*Our history is littered with tragedy and despair.*

**We can do better.**

*We visit countless cruelties and injustices on each other to this day.*

**So we must do better.**

*We lost five hundred million to Smallpox.*

**So we destroyed Smallpox.**

*Hundreds of millions of us are still in poverty.*

**But fewer every year.**

*Hundreds of thousands are lost to Malaria.*

**But fewer every year.**

*Our problems are legion.*

**Then so will our compassion, dedication, and ingenuity.**

There is no destiny written for us.

**Then we will write our own.**

*We may lose.*

**But we will try anyway**

** *because there isn’t anyone else.* **
