<p>[This probably works best with three speakers, each taking one part.]</p>
<p>Narrator: You’d be surprised of how much of management, consulting, teaching, senior ICing, etc is: New: “I want to X.” Old: “Have you written down a plausible plan to get to X with steps listed in order?” New: “No.” Old: “Alright let’s sketch it. OK step one: are you going to do it?” New: “Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>Narrator: Generally the person doesn’t sound that silly or pathologically helpless in the meeting. Sometimes they are a committee of extremely intelligent people, because only a large and well-resourced organization acting in concert can reach the heights of no-agency-exists-anywhere.</p>
<p>Narrator: I have scheduled a performance review for the director of hiring people who manage people that do feasibility studies into best practices for doing step one! I deserve a promotion! Again, doesn’t sound quite that silly when you’re spending literally tens of millions doing it.</p>
<p>Narrator: While I’m on the subject of questions not asked. Old: “How do you plan to X?” New: “I don’t know.” Old: “Have you read how to X?” New: “Nothing responsive on Google.” Old: “Has anyone ever Xed before?” New: “Probably yes.” Old: “Have you talked to them about X?” New: “Talked to who?” Old: “Seriously name one person any…” New: “Well I suppose this team at this company might have Xed.” Old: “Great who leads that team go talk to them.” New: “I don’t know who leads that team.” Old: “And you searched LinkedIn and Twitter before telling me that because of course you would.” New: “LOL what.” Old: “OK in future that is a thing.” Old: “But today OK let’s navigate that org by starting with one well-placed person inside of it. Literally anyone works.” New: “Can you intro me to them?” Old:“Quite plausibly but this is a really important skill can you find one person who works there.” New: “Uhh I could email customer service.” Old: “Wow I am impressed that is actually the tiniest possible spark of greatness. But could you start somewhere more efficient than going through CS like say a staff engineer.” New: “I don’t know any.” Old: “Does GitHub or YouTube or any conference speaker list or…” New: “OK supposing I can name someone then what.” Old: “Send an email.” New: “What should that email say?” Old: “It can say so many things, but two important ones are your name and that you want to talk about their experiences with X.” New: “Will they want to talk about X.” Old: “Likely; we will read reply.”</p>
