<h2 id="by-robert-frost">By Robert Frost</h2>
<p>Before man came to blow it right The wind once blew itself untaught, And did its loudest day and night In any rough place where it caught.</p>
<p>Man came to tell it what was wrong: It hadn’t found the place to blow; It blew too hard—the aim was song. And listen—how it ought to go!</p>
<p>He took a little in his mouth, And held it long enough for north To be converted into south, And then by measure blew it forth.</p>
<p>By measure. It was word and note, The wind the wind had meant to be— A little through the lips and throat. The aim was song—the wind could see.</p>
