<p>THERE IS an order. Such an order.<br />
Each event a word that must be read<br />
or else, my friend— Today I woke up shorter,</p>
<p>sleep playing pestle to my twin bed’s mortar,<br />
me the poor shaved meat. But no regret—<br />
an order to these things, you see, there’s order.</p>
<p>Each man a crack at playing cosmic sorter.<br />
Within each uncracked code-shell is a threat.<br />
Today, take notice; time is getting shorter.</p>
