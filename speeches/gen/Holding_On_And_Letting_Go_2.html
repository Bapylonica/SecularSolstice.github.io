<p>You can keep your eyes open or close them, whatever you’re most comfortable with. Take a minute to get in touch with yourself in this moment. Take a few deep breaths. Notice what it’s like to be you in this moment. Notice what it’s like to be sitting. Notice what your body feels like. Notice what emotions you’re feeling.</p>
<p>Now bring your attention to something important you need to do. Maybe a project for work. Or something in your personal life.</p>
<p>Notice if your reaction is closer to giving up at the first sign of failure or to holding on long after you should.</p>
<p>Take a minute to sit with that urge. The overwhelming fear of failure that makes it hard to hold on or start this thing you need to do. Or the feeling of it being so important that you can’t imagine giving up – even if it’s impossible.</p>
<p>Now imagine the opposite urge. Hold the important thing in your mind and imagine holding on even if failure feels overwhelming and you can’t bring yourself to start. Or imagine giving up even when it feels so important.</p>
<p>Notice what it’s like holding this in your mind. Any emotions that come up – resistance, fear, discomfort – just notice them and try to let them exist in your mind without pushing them away.</p>
<p>In this moment, the goal is not to convince your mind to change your urge or do something different with regards to this important thing. It’s merely to bring awareness to how your mind works and what your urges are.</p>
<p>Now go back to the urge you naturally are drawn to. And notice what it’s like holding that in your mind. Notice if your body feels any different. Notice any emotions that come up.</p>
<p>And when you’re ready, come back to the group.</p>
