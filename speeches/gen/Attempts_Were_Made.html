<p>Scott Alexander once described a particular building in europe thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems haunted. It's beautiful enough, full of artwork praising peace and the brotherhood of mankind, complete with Latin invocations and Biblical quotes on all the walls. In the center is a great council chamber, where the delegates used to meet. But yesterday it was dead silent. There's something eerie about sitting there, in this empty room where people once tried to save the world, failed, and then disappeared...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you may say: the world is still here. The horror those people fought was not literally the end of the world.</p>
<p>Still, they gathered: the greatest idealists of the age. The organized. They built a grand headquarters. All to one aim: to ensure that no matter what happened in politics or economics or technology, <em>there would never be a second world war</em>.</p>
<p>The building is still there.</p>
<p>TODO: write the rest of this</p>
