<h1 id="samurai">Samurai</h1>
<p>Warmup game from Improvisational theatre.</p>
<p>One player is the Samurai - she starts by lifting her Katana (sword), making a Japanese- nsounding grunt. She keeps her sword up in the air, and her 2 neighbors &quot;slaughter&quot; her, by swinging their swords into her sides, again grunting enthusiastically and in pseudo-japanese. When the neighbors retract their swords, the Samurai lowers her sword; while doing this she makes eye contact with another player, when then becomes Samurai, and everything starts all over again.</p>
<p>Start slowly, and then increase the tempo.</p>
