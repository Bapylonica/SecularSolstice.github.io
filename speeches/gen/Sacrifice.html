<p>This activity is designed to help participants cope with loss. It requires each participant to have paper and a writing implement, and a fire or other place where paper can be burned.</p>
<p>Ask participants to write down something they have lost in the past year.</p>
<p>Then (this can happen at a later point in the program) ask each person to burn their piece of paper.</p>
<p>[TODO: ask Rivka for what she said about burning the paper]</p>
