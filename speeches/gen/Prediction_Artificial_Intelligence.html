<h1 id="prediction-artificial-intelligence">Prediction: Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>In 1950, Alan Turing wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In the year 2000, phrases like &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;machine learning&quot; had entered the mainstream, but researchers in those fields remained as compulsively contradictory as ever.</p>
