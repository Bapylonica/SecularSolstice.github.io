<h1 id="litany-of-tarski">Litany of Tarski</h1>
<h2 id="by-alfred-tarski">By Alfred Tarski (?)</h2>
<p>This is not a specific speach. It is anything of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If X, I desire to believe X.</p>
<p>If NOT X, I desire to believe that NOT X.</p>
<p>Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used at solstice, usually it is recited several times, beginning with innocuous Xs like &quot;The sky is blue&quot; or &quot;The earth is a sphere&quot; and working up to &quot;I should abandon my plans&quot; or &quot;We are all going to die&quot;. There can also be a metalitany, where X is &quot;reciting the Litany of Tarski is helpful&quot;. The metalitany can be recited in a modified form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If reciting this litany is helpful, I desire to recite this litany.</p>
<p>If reciting this litany is not helpful, I desire not to recite this litany.</p>
<p>Let me not become attached to habits I may not want.</p>
</blockquote>
