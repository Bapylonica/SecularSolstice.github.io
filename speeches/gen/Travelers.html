<h1 id="travelers">Travelers</h1>
<p>Every creature or thing,<br />
is on a journey somewhere;<br />
a personal voyage,<br />
or sharing the fare;</p>
<p>with many advances<br />
we’ve achieved quite a lot,<br />
from the smallest of needles<br />
to the concept of thought.</p>
<p>As all travelers know,<br />
the road seldom seems clear;<br />
it’s paved with regret,<br />
and riddled with fear.</p>
<p>The more we advanced<br />
with the stride of our boots,<br />
the harder it seemed<br />
to connect to our roots;</p>
<p>some things which were simple<br />
were forgotten or lost,<br />
and at times it does seem<br />
we cannot bare the cost,</p>
<p>yet we must carry on,<br />
just remember to hold<br />
a strong, deep connection<br />
to the wisdom of old.</p>
<p>We all lost ourselves,<br />
we’ve all once went astray,<br />
but the fact that we’re here<br />
means we’re on the right way.</p>
<p>So let us rejoice,<br />
celebrate where we are,<br />
for bonded together<br />
we are bound to go far.</p>
