<p>At this time, in this place, we have gathered to celebrate the Solstice.</p>
<p>At other times, in this place, there might be an art gallery or a corporate meeting hall. Perhaps one day we will consecrate a lasting space for ourselves. But today, tonight, this place is what we have, and what we have is this.</p>
<p>Let us divide here and now from here and yesterday, or from now and anywhere else. Where we are affects who we are. So let us claim this space fully. Let it become entirely ours, so that we can be entirely ourselves.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I ask you to rise and turn to the East (that way) with me...</p>
<p>By the virtues of East, By the rising sun and the innocent curiosity of youth, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we filter incoming ideas lest we be overwhelmed. On this night, let us resolve to consider all we hear.</p>
<p>(And together we say)</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of East, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
<p>(Please turn to the south)</p>
<p>By the virtues of South, By heat, passion and will. Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we live among outsiders, and worry what they will think of us. On this night, we are in our own space. We have claimed it by our will. Outsiders and their opinions can stay out.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of South, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of West, By the setting sun and the wisdom of age, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we worry over our immediate tasks and obligations. On this night, let us strive to perceive the vast expanse of history.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of West, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of North, By the solidarity and friendship we share with one another Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we are scattered. Tonight, we sit together. We support each other. We are one people.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of North, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
<p>(Please face me and look down)</p>
<p>By the virtues of Down, By pain, guilt and fear -- the great gifts no one wants, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we flinch from the worst possibilities, either for our own sake or to avoid looking weak to a predator. Tonight, as one people, we face the darkness squarely.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of Down, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
<p>By the virtues of Up, By the stars and the hope and ambition to reach them, Let us bound and consecrate this space.</p>
<p>On all other nights, we hide our greatest ambitions, lest we be thought of as cheating at status games. Tonight we speak them openly, and remember that however distant they may be, they are good ambitions.</p>
<p><em>By the virtues of Up, we bound and consecrate this space.</em></p>
