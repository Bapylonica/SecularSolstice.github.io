# Nothing is Mere
## By John Keats and Richard Feynman

“...Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.”
—John Keats, Lamia


“Nothing is ‘mere’.”
—Richard Feynman
