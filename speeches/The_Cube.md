# The Cube
## By Annie Gottlieb

This is an imagination / storytelling game in which participants describe a cube, and then various more mundane objects around it.  There's a twist, but I won't give it away here.  You can read all about it in [the official book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009G235YG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
