# The Gift We Give Tomorrow
## By Eliezer Yudkowsky and Raymond Arnold
    
How, oh how could the universe,    
itself unloving, and mindless,    
cough up creatures capable of love?

But natural selection is cruel. Bloody.     
And bloody stupid!    
    
Even when organisms *aren't* directly tearing at each other's throats…    
…there's a deeper competition, going on between the genes.    
A species could evolve to extinction,    
if the winning genes were playing negative sum games    
    
How could a process,    
Cruel as Azathoth,    
Create minds that were capable of love?

But mothers can adopt their children.    
And still, come to love them.

Well, fine. But still:    
    
Humans form friendships,    
even with non-relatives.    
How can that be?

> the most dangerous human is not the strongest,     
> the prettiest,    
> or even the smartest:    
> But the one who has the most allies.    
    
But not all friends are fair-weather friends;     
there are *true* friends -     
those who would sacrifice their lives for another.    
    
Shouldn't that kind of devotion    
remove itself from the gene pool?    
    
> You said it yourself:    
> We have a concept of true friendship and fair-weather friendship.     
> We wouldn't be true friends with someone who we didn't think was a true friend to us.    
> And one with many true friends?    
> They are far more formidable    
> than one with mere fair-weather allies.    
    
And Mohandas Gandhi,       
who really did turn the other cheek?       
Those who try to serve all humanity,       
whether or not all humanity serves them in turn?

Um... what?    
How does that explain Gandhi?    
    
> The point is that we can argue about 'What should be done?'    
> We can make those arguments and respond to them.    
> Without that, politics couldn't take place.    
    
Okay... but Gandhi?    
    
> Believed certain complicated propositions about 'What should be done?'    
> Then did them.    
    
That sounds suspiciously like it could explain any possible human behavior.

And that gets you Gandhi?

Hell no. But -

I'm not postulating a god!    
I'm just asking how human beings ended up so *nice.*    
    
> *Nice?*    
> Have you looked at this planet lately?

> Humans aren't always nice.    
    
But, still, come on...     
doesn't it seem a little...     
amazing?    
    
That nothing but millions of years of a cosmic death tournament…    
could cough up mothers and fathers,     
sisters and brothers,     
husbands and wives,     
steadfast friends,    
honorable enemies,     
true altruists and guardians of causes,     
police officers and loyal defenders,     
even artists, sacrificing themselves for their art?    
    
All practicing so many kinds of love?     
For so many things other than genes?     
    
Doing their part to make their world less ugly,    
something besides a sea of blood and violence and mindless replication?

...    
    
But how are you *not* amazed?    
    
Maybe there’s no surprise from a causal viewpoint.     
    
But still, it seems to me,     
in the creation of humans by evolution,     
something happened that is precious and marvelous and wonderful.     
    
If we can’t call it a physical miracle, then call it a moral miracle.    
    
> Because it was only a miracle from the perspective of the morality that was produced?    
> Explaining away all the apparent coincidence,    
> from a causal and physical perspective?    
    
Well... yeah. I suppose you could interpret it that way.    
    
I just meant that something was immensely surprising and wonderful on a moral level,    
even if it's not really surprising,    
on a physical level.    
    
> I think that's what I said.    
    
It just seems to me that in your view, somehow you explain that wonder away.    
    
> No.
