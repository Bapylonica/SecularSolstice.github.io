# Prediction: Phenotypes

In 2018, Scott Alexander predicted:

> Polygenic scores [will] go public â€“ not necessarily by 2023, but not long after. It [will] become possible to look at your 23andMe results and get a weak estimate of your height, IQ, criminality, et cetera.

A service to do exactly this -- not especially well, but as well as cutting edge research allowed -- had already been in service for a year and a half when the prediction was made.
