# Villanelle
## By Danielle Blau

THERE IS an order. Such an order.    
Each event a word that must be read    
or else, my friend— Today I woke up shorter,    

sleep playing pestle to my twin bed’s mortar,    
me the poor shaved meat. But no regret—    
an order to these things, you see, there’s order.    

Each man a crack at playing cosmic sorter.    
Within each uncracked code-shell is a threat.    
Today, take notice; time is getting shorter.
