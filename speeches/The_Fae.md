# The Fae
## By James Babcock

The original Eldritch horrors, before Lovecraft, were fairies - the
fae. In stories, the morality of the Fae is amoral and capricious -
not black and white, but orange and gray. They arenâ€™t chaotic--they
follow rules, just, rules that are unintuitive, not the sorts of rules
humans would normally follow. And if you squint a little, at the
mythology of ancient people defeating the Fae by understanding their
rules, it matches pretty well to slightly-less-ancient people
defeating aspects of physics by understanding its rules.

In myth, the Fae are vulnerable to iron and salt. The challenges of
physics were vulnerable to machines and iodization. In myth, the fae
cast strange curses which humans defeat with seemingly
equally-arbitrary rituals. We protect ourselves by wash our hands
before we eat, and injecting small amounts of diseases into our blood.

In myths, the Fae present problems that seem impossible. This song,
Scarborough Fair, presents such a series of seemingly-impossible
challenges:
