# Letter from Utopia
## by Nick Bostrom, excerpted by Daniel Speyer

Nick Bostrom -- the same Nick Bostrom who gave us that "Disneyland with no Children" image from earlier -- also wrote what he called a "letter from utopia".  The full text is long, but in it he writes:

> Have you ever experienced a moment of bliss? On the rapids of inspiration maybe, your mind tracing the shapes of truth and beauty? Or in the pulsing ecstasy of love? Or in a glorious triumph achieved with true friends? Or in a conversation on a vine-overhung terrace one star-appointed night? Or perhaps a melody smuggled itself into your heart, charming it and setting it alight with kaleidoscopic emotions? Or when you prayed, and felt heard?
>
> Yet a little later, scarcely an hour gone by, and the ever-falling soot of ordinary life is already covering the whole thing. The silver and gold of exuberance lose their shine, and the marble becomes dirty.
>
> And so, the door that was ajar begins to close, and so the sliver of hope wanes, until nothing remains but a closed possibility. And then, not even a possibility. Not even a conceivability.
>
> Quick, stop that door from closing! Shove your foot in so it does not slam shut.
>
> And let the faint draught of the beyond continue to whisper of a higher state. Feel it on your face, the tender words of what could be!
