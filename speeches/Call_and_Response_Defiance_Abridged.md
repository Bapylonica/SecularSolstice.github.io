# Call and Response: Defiance
## By Jai Dhyani (Abridged by Daniel Speyer)

(Speaker lines in *italics*, audience response in **bold**)

*The universe is vast, and dark, and cold.*

**But we are not.**

*The laws of physics are indifferent to hope, or desperation, or love.*

**But we are not.**

*There is no destiny written for us.*

**Then we will write our own.**

*Does anything in the universe care?*

**Yes! We care! There is light in the world, and it is us!**
