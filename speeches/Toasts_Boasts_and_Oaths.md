# Toasts Boasts and Oaths

One person introduces 3 plush animals with a short story and then shows how you can grab an animal to make a Toast, Boast or Oath:

* make an announcement/compliment to individuals or a group = toast
* "brag" about something you've accomplished = boast
* commit to something = oath

We are sitting in a circle and everyone is invited to contribute toasts, boasts or oaths. This was done for a while, with the group reacting encouragingly to contributions. The plushies can be available for the rest of the weekend for spontaneous exclamations too.
