# Schedule Planning

#### Before the Solstice

Attendees at the solstice (either all or many) bring content to be
used, tagged with where in the arc it goes (light, twilight, night or
morning).

The organizer creates a preliminary schedule, talking to contributors
as needed.

#### This Activity

Put the preliminary schedule into a form that's easy to reorder.  This
could be a Google Doc displayed via data projector or sticky notes
along a wall (write large and in sharpie).

When people bring last-minute content, insert it somewhere
appropriate.  Don't rethink the order from scratch.  Even if this
results in a suboptimal total ordering, it's not worth the time.

Then go over the entire proposed schedule with everyone and make sure
everybody's ok with it.  Make changes as needed.

Or, if there's a general consensus that the room trusts you and
everybody wants to start, just go ahead with the schedule as is.
