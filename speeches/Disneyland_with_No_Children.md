# Disneyland with No Children
## by Nick Bostrom, Scott Alexander and Daniel Speyer

But even after we have thrown away science, art, love, and philosophy, there’s still one thing left to lose.  One final sacrifice runaway competitive pressure might demand of us: being anyone at all.

To quote Nick Bostrom:

> We could imagine, as an extreme case, a technologically highly advanced society, containing many complex structures, some of them far more intricate and intelligent than anything that exists on the planet today – a society which nevertheless lacks any type of being that is conscious or whose welfare has moral significance. In a sense, this would be an uninhabited society. It would be a society of economic miracles and technological awesomeness, with nobody there to benefit. A Disneyland with no children.
