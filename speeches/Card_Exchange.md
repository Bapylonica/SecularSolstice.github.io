# Card Exchange

This activity is a simple icebreaker. It gets harder the more people you have.

Each participant is given one or two halves of torn playing cards-- be sure that
you give out all the torn halves, to ensure there will be a match for every torn
half.

Then the participants are instructed to find the other person(s) with a matching
half to theirs, and introduce themselves.
