# Travelers
    
Every creature or thing,    
is on a journey somewhere;    
a personal voyage,    
or sharing the fare;    
     
with many advances    
we’ve achieved quite a lot,    
from the smallest of needles    
to the concept of thought.    
     
As all travelers know,    
the road seldom seems clear;    
it’s paved with regret,    
and riddled with fear.    
     
The more we advanced    
with the stride of our boots,    
the harder it seemed    
to connect to our roots;    
     
some things which were simple    
were forgotten or lost,    
and at times it does seem    
we cannot bare the cost,    
     
yet we must carry on,    
just remember to hold    
a strong, deep connection    
to the wisdom of old.    
     
We all lost ourselves,    
we’ve all once went astray,    
but the fact that we’re here    
means we’re on the right way.    
     
So let us rejoice,    
celebrate where we are,    
for bonded together    
we are bound to go far.
