# First Step
## By Sir Terry Pratchett

They do say that if you wish to walk the path to wisdom then for your
first step you must become as a small child.

Do you think they've heard about the second step?

The path to wisdom does, in fact, begin with a single step.

Where people go wrong is in ignoring all the thousands of other steps
that come after it. They make the single step of deciding to become
one with the universe, and for some reason forget to take the logical
next step of living for seventy years on a mountain and a daily bowl
of rice and yak-butter tea that would give it any kind of
meaning. While evidence says that the road to Hell is paved with good
intentions, they're probably all on first steps.
