# Sacrifice
## By Rivka Fleischman

This activity is designed to help participants cope with loss. It requires each
participant to have paper and a writing implement, and a fire or other place
where paper can be burned.

Ask participants to write down something they have lost in the past year. 

Then (this can happen at a later point in the program) ask each person to burn
their piece of paper.

[TODO: ask Rivka for what she said about burning the paper]
