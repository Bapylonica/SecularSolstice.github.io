# Sacrifice
## By Rivka Fleischman

This activity is designed to help participants cope with loss. It requires each
participant to have paper and a writing implement, and a fire or other place
where paper can be burned.

Ask participants to write down something they have lost in the past year. 

Then (this can happen at a later point in the program) ask each person to burn
their piece of paper.

"It's one thing to know that you've lost something. It's another thing to
actually feel like it's lost. To understand that it's never coming back. Now,
we will take a step to making us really feel like what we've lost is gone. We
will burn what we wrote down. We will burn what we lost."
