# COVID: We Lost
## by Rivka Fleischman

There is a saying I was raised with. “If you save one person, it is as if you’ve
saved the entire world”. I think what my community meant by it is that you may
feel disheartened and give up because you cannot save the world. But saving just
one life is so meaningful, that even if that’s all you can do, that’s enough.

> two human lives are twice as unimaginably valuable.

As of today, globally, there have been 5 million, 280 thousand deaths from
coronavirus. 5 million, 280 thousand people we failed to save. 5 million, 280
thousand worlds we could have saved. 

We know all this suffering and death is bad. But it’s hard for us to visualize
just how bad. We feel like it’s worse than one person dying. But we don’t feel
that it’s 5 million times worse. It’s hard for us to conceptualize that much
pain, suffering, and death. 

It would take over 13 days to walk that many feet. That many seconds would be
more than 61 days. Approximately that many years ago humans split off from other
apes in the tree of evolution. That many miles is approximately 22 times the
distance between the earth and the moon. 

Each of those 5 million, 280 thousand lives is one person whose life was cut
short. One person who had so much potential to do good. One network of people
whose lives with never be the same after they lost someone they cared about. 5
million, 280 thousand lost lives that we could have saved. That’s too many. 

Those lives are gone; we’ve failed them. We cannot erase our mistakes. 

The monster that caused those deaths is not going anywhere. Covid continues to
mutate and grow. It will be here. Haunting and stalking us. Wreaking havoc in
its path. The world will never be the same.

So now, remembering the lives we’ve lost and the people we’ve failed, we move
forward. We accept our mistakes and we find the best route forward. The route
that does the most good going forward. 

But tonight, we sit with the lives we’ve lost and the future we’ve lost, and we
mourn. Tonight, we grieve for the world we do not have.
