# One Song, Many Tyrants
## By Daniel Speyer

The song we just sang is older than you might think.  There are hints
of it as far back as the twelfth century, and the German lyrics had
reached their canonical form by 1780 at the latest.  The English
translation we just sang, is, of course, far more recent, with a few
liberties to ensure scansion.

This one song, which had to be written but once, has been a thorn in
the side of every tyrant to oppress Germans ever since.  From the
Austro-Hungarians straight through to the eastern communists.

How *much* of a thorn was it?  Unclear.  Many oppressive governments
withstood it.  But enough of a thorn to be banned in 1848.  That's a
pretty good sign.
