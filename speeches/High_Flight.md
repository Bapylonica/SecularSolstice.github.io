# High Flight 
## By John Gillespie Magee, Jr.

Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,     
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;     
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth of sun-split clouds -     
and done a hundred things You have not dreamed of -     
wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence.     
Hovering there I've chased the shouting wind along     
and flung my eager craft through footless halls of air.    

Up, up the long delirious burning blue     
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,     
where never lark, or even eagle, flew;     
and, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod     
the high untrespassed sanctity of space,     
put out my hand and touched the face of God.
