# Prediction: Ozone

In 1986, William Mansfield of the United Nations Environment Programme wrote:

> We recognize that the potential dangers to the ozone layer from Man-made chemical releases will require emission controls. Adverse consequences can flow from the smallest depletion. A *single* percentage-point loss of ozone can induce a six per cent increase in certain types of disfiguring skin-cancer. Yet projections of ozone depletion related to *zero growth* of CFC emissions approach *five* per cent, and with only moderate growth double-figure depletions are projected.

We'll never know how bad the skin cancer would have gotten, because we got the emission controls instead.  Less than a year after he wrote that, the world's governments -- guided by meteorologists and aided by chemists -- agreed to a gradual but complete phase-out of CFCs.  Within ten years, the ozone layer was showing clear signs of recovery.
