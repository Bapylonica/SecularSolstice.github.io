# Henry Williamson on Christmas Aftermath

Two days later an Army Order came from G.H.Q., to the effect that men
found fraternising with the enemy would be court-martialled, and, if
found guilty, would suffer the death penalty. And again in that place
the Very lights soared over No Man’s Land at night, and bullets cut
showers of splinters from the trees, and sometimes human flesh and
bone. So Hope sank into the mud again, but did not die, despite a
withering anew as each poor human unit fell in machine-gun mort-blast
and colossal reverberating rending of the shells of those four years –
the years whose truth seems to be incommunicable.
