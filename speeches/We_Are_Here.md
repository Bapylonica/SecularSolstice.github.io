# We Are Here
## By Daniel Speyer

Is there someone out there to hear?

Yes.

I am.

And you are.

And I know that isn't the answer some of you were hoping for.  But it's true.

I told you before that tonight isn't about blind hope, and it's not.  But it is about hope.  A brighter future can happen if people like us make it possible.

And I know that there are people in this room working toward making tomorrow dawn brighter, or to protecting the chance the it dawns at all.

So if you are working directly toward one of those goals, whether in science or art, politics or business – whatever field you have found to be a lever fitted to your hand and long enough to nudge the world with – then I ask you to rise and say that you are here.

And if you are working indirectly, by giving money, evaluating levers, administering, inspiring – whatever the means – I ask you also to rise and say that you are here.

If you want to do something, or hope to do something, but it will have to wait until you find the right lever, or until you grow stronger, (and I fully expect that everyone in this room will grow stronger), then please rise and say that you are here.

If you are prepared to be a friend to someone who is doing something, please rise and say that you are here.

If anyone is still seated, please rise.
